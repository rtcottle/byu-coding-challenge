# Code Challenge: Movie App

## Description

This is a coding challenge to build a movie search app in a 4 hour-limit.

## Future direction

I would like to get the api call working so that I can format the page similar to a social media page with cards about each movie. I would also like to add some storage use to keep searches saved for the user that may frequent certain titles.
